# Introduction to C++

Course excercises from Stepik.org course "Introduction to C++" (In russian).

Small programs didn't make it in this repository, since it was much easier to code them on Stepik directly.

## Most useful exercises

- [Task 14: Hacking classes](./task_14_hacking_class/main.cpp) (Getting access to private members);
- [Task 18: Hacking vtables](./task_14_hacking_class/main.cpp) (Checking if inherited classes are of the same type using vtables, which C++ does not allow).
