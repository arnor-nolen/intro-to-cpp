# Programming in C++

Course excercises from Stepik.org courses ["Programming in C++"](https://stepik.org/course/7) and ["Programming in C++ (cont.)"](https://stepik.org/course/3206).

Both courses are taught **in russian** and free for use. I strongly encourage everyone that is interested in C++ to complete these courses.

However, if you plan to enroll to these courses yourself, please, **don't use these solutions**. The repository is mainly for myself to keep track and review my progress as I go.

**P.S.** Small excercises didn't make it in this repository, since it was much easier to code them on Stepik directly.

**P.P.S** Here I will attach links to the certificates as I get them.

## Most useful exercises

### Programming in C++

- [Task 14: Hacking classes](./programming_in_cpp/task_14_hacking_class/main.cpp) (Getting access to private members of a class);
- [Task 18: Hacking vtables](./programming_in_cpp/task_18_hacking_vtables/main.cpp) (Checking if classes are of the same type using vtables, which C++ does not allow);
- [Task 25: Shared pointer](./programming_in_cpp/task_25_smart_pointer_shared/main.cpp) (Writing custom `shared_ptr`).

### Programming in C++ (cont.)

- [Task 4: Checking types](./programming_in_cpp_cont/task_4_checking_types/main.cpp) (Same task as Task 18 from the first course, but using `typeid`);
- [Task 16: Custom iterator](./programming_in_cpp_cont/task_16_custom_iterator/main.cpp) (Writing custom iterator for `std::list<std::vector\<T>>`);
- [Task 21: MapReduce](./programming_in_cpp_cont/task_21_map_reduce/main.cpp) (Writing custom MapReduce using `std::async`).
